* Lecture 1: Particles, Fields & Forces

Any particle can be exchanged in some context or another. So every kind of
particle in one way or another produces a force.

Example:

Covalent bounds: sharing an electron

Coulomb: exchange photons

* Lecture 2: Quantum Chromodynamics

Gluons interact with each other forces between gluons.

* Lecture 3: Group Theory - Part 1

* Lecture 4: Group Theory - Part 2

* Lecture 5: Gauge Fields and Symmetry

Anytime that has conserved quantity analogous to electric charge which functions
as the source of photon like field, that called a gague theory. Gauge theories
are always based on symmetries.

* Lecture 6: The Weak Interaction

Why weak interactions give such slow decay rates?

* Lecture 7: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking & Goldstone Bosons

How a particle like the photon can get a mass from something called spontaneous
symmetry breaking?

How if the symmetry group associated with the photon were broken spontaneously
how it would give the photon of mass.

How gauge bosons like the photon get a mass when spontaneous symmetry breaking?

what is the symmetry incidentally when I say you associated with photon? There's
a conserved quantity which is the charge. Conserved quantities always go with
symmetries. What's the symmetry that's connected with the conservation of
electric charge? It's thing which multiplies the charged fields by a phase.

#+begin_quote
Example of the Higgs phenomenon: Superconductor

Photon get a mass and the $U(1)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken.
#+end_quote

Not the same as photon in prism!

\begin{align}
E = \hbar \omega \\
p = \hbar k \\
\omega = c k
\end{align}

if $\omega = 0$ , then $k = 0$ , we call massless.

$E = \sqrt{p^{2} + m^2}$ , if $p = 0$ , the energy is not zero, that's the mass.

Oscillations of a field when it is homogeneous when is has infinite wavelength
those are the things we call mass.

The Goldstone boson got eaten by the gauge boson resulting in giving the Higgs
boson a mass.

* Lecture 8: The Higgs Field

Gauge invariance is a symmetry which prohibits the photon from having a mass.

* Lecture 9: The Higgs Field & Fermions

| massless photons          |   | Higgs      |   | massive photon       |
| massless Goldstone bosons |   | $\Longrightarrow$        |   | no Goldstone boson   |
| massive Higgs bosons      |   | phenomenon |   | massive Higgs bosons |

Mass stands for energy at rest, but it also stands for energy associated with
uniform homogeneous shifts of fields.

Moving the plus charges relative to the minus charges -> plasma. Plamas have
mass, phonons do not.

$\beta$ decay: mirror, discreate, not a symmetry of weak interaction.

Mass term is a thing which turns left handed to right handed.

Mass is always for fermions, it always left hand, trun into the right hand,
right hand ...

* Lecture 10: Running of Coupling Constant

Condense: which means the field for this field of particle gets shifted.
