* Helium (last lecture)

\begin{align}
\vec{S} = \vec{S}(1) + \vec{S}(2)
\end{align}

All spin operators are symmetric against particle exchange. In other words, if
you couple to the spin through a magnetic field, you couple to the two electrons
symmetrically. And therefore, you have the selection rule only symmetric and
symmetric ( $S \leftrightarrow S$ ) & anti-symmetric and anti-symmetric ( $A \leftrightarrow A$ ) states
couple. 也就是说 Hamiltonian 中的自旋算符不改变自旋的组态.

Spatial and spin symmetry (S. A) are both good quantum numbers. Formally, all
observables $\hat{O}$ commute with particle exchange operator (自旋和空间没有耦
合)
\begin{align}
[P_{ij}, \hat{O}] = 0
\end{align}

As long as wavefunctions and operators separate into spin-dependent and
space-dependent parts
\begin{align}
P_{12} = P_{12}^{\mathrm{space}} P_{12}^{\mathrm{spin}}
\end{align}
and both $P_{12}$ 's are conserved.

Singlets $\leftrightarrow$ Triplets transition requires violation of above assumption.

Mixing of spin and spatial WF by spin orbit coupling.

Spin-orbital coupling $\propto Z^4$ . Weak for Helium, $2^{3}s$ is VERY long lived
8000s (It's one of the most longest-lived metastable states you can imagine and
which you find in atomic physics)

Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe 40s.(longer, because of stronger nuclear charge)

Mg, Ca, Sr have inter-combination lines, are candidate for atomic clocks (kHz
line width). If the line width is kilohertz, the lifetime is millisecond ...

Decay path: 1 photon M1(we discuss it later in the course), and not 2-photons as
believed earlier). The decay path requires higher order terms using the Dirac
equation with coupling to the electromagnetic field.

* Fine Structure

| Electronic energy | Ryd, $\alpha^2 mc^2$        |
| Fine structure    | $\alpha^4 mc^2$ , $\alpha^2$ Ryd |
| Lamb shifts       | $\alpha^5 mc^2$ , GHz       |

Fine structure: $\alpha^4 mc^2$ .
Exact picture: Dirac equation. The solution of the Dirac equation for the
hydrogen atom gives us the electronic structure, the same as comes out of the
Bohr model, but now including the fine structure.

** Fine Structure: 3 contributions

- kinetic

- spin-orbit

- Darwin term

Pauli approximation to the Dirac equation (expand Dirac equation in power of
$v/c$ , lowest order):
\begin{align}
H =& mc^{2} + \frac{p^2}{2m} - \frac{e^2}{r} \\
   & - \frac{p^4}{8m^3c^2}\quad \mathrm{kinetic} \\
   & + \frac{\hbar^2e^2}{2m^2 c^2}\frac{1}{r^3} \vec{L}\cdot \vec{S} \quad \mathrm{spin-orbit}\\
   & - \frac{\hbar^2}{8 m^2c^2}\nabla^2 \frac{e^2}{r} \quad \mathrm{Darwin}
\end{align}

*** Kinetic energy

\begin{align}
E = \sqrt{(mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
T = E - mc^2 \approx \frac{p^2}{2m} - \frac{1}{8}\frac{p^4}{m^3c^2}
\end{align}

*** Spin-orbit interaction
insightful: what do we have to add to the Schrodinger
equation to get it? Spin!

$e^-$
- intrinsic angular moment $\hbar \vec{S}$
- magnetic moment $\mu = g\mu_0 \vec{S}$ ( $g = 2$ , $\mu_0$ Bohr magneton)

moving electron "sees" motional magnetic field.
\begin{align}
B_{\mathrm{mot}} = - \frac{\vec{v}}{c}\times \vec{E}
    = - \frac{\vec{v}}{c}\times \frac{e}{r^3}\vec{r} = \frac{e\hbar}{mc} \frac{1}{r^3}\vec{L}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
H_{\mathrm{S.O.}} = - \vec{\mu}\cdot \vec{B}
 = \frac{e^2 \hbar^2}{m^2 c^2}\frac{1}{r^3}\vec{S}\cdot \vec{L}
\end{align}

relativistic transformations
\begin{align}
\vec{\Omega}_{\mathrm{T}} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\vec{a}\times \vec{v}}{c^2}
\quad
\begin{pmatrix}
= 0, \quad \vec{a} // \vec{v} \\
\mathrm{Thomas}\, \mathrm{procession}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
according to Lecture 2
\begin{align}
\vec{B}_{\mathrm{T}} = \frac{1}{\gamma_e}\vec{\Omega}_{\mathrm{T}},
 \gamma_e = \frac{e}{mc}, \vec{a} = \frac{e^2}{mr^3}\vec{r}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\Rightarrow B_{\mathrm{T}} = \frac{1}{2}B_{\mathrm{mot}}
\end{align}

*** Darwin term

electron is "smeared(not localized) out" over Compton wavelength $\frac{\hbar}{mc}$

German word: Zitterbewegung (trembling motion)

fells averaged Coulomb potential $\bar{V(r)}$

small displacement $\vec{s}$
\begin{align}
V(\vec{r} + \vec{s}) = v(\vec{r}) + \vec{\nabla} V\cdot \vec{s}
 + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} s_{xi}s_{xj} \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}
\end{align}
the correction:
\begin{align}
\Delta V = \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\hbar}{mc}\right)^2 \nabla^2V
    = - \frac{1}{6} \frac{e^2\hbar^2}{m^2c^2}\nabla^2 \frac{1}{r}
\end{align}
$\nabla^2\frac{1}{r} \Rightarrow$ only s electrons which have a non-vanishing probability to
feel the origin of the Coulomb potential.
Exact coefficition is $\frac{1}{8}$ .

*** summary

|                    | s electrons | $l\neq 0$ | sign |
| rel KE             | Yes         | Yes     | $-$  |
| $\vec{L}\cdot \vec{S}$ | No          | Yes     | $+/-$ |
| Darwin             | Yes         | No      | $+$  |

the Darwin term reduces the binding energy, because it sort of takes a cusp (a
point of transition between two different states) away from the Coulomb
interaction.

Spin-orbit is not diagonal in $\vec{L}, \vec{S}$ . So what we have to do is we
have to introduce now:
\begin{align}
(\vec{L} + \vec{S})^2 = \vec{J}^{2}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\vec{L}\cdot \vec{S} = \frac{1}{2}(\vec{J}^2 - \vec{L}^2 - \vec{S}^2)
\end{align}
So, therefore, the LS interaction is diagonal in the J basis.

加上 Kinetic 和 Darwin 项之后, $^2S_{1/2}, ^2P_{1/2}$ 又重新简并. If we would use
a non-relativistic approach, and derive the Darwin term, the spin orbit term,
and the relativistic correction separately, there would be no reason. It would
just look like a freak(a thing, person, animal, or event that is extremely
unusual or unlikely, and not like any other…) accident in nature that those two
levels come out equal. However, it's not a freak accident. *It's a symmetry of
the Dirac equation.* So all those corrections have a deep connection in
relativistic physics. And *relativistic physics preserves the degeneracy in $J$*
.

Fine structure does not lift the degeneracy between $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{1/2}$
. When we use the Dirac equation, we can get an exact expression for the fine
structure:
\begin{align}
E_{\mathrm{F.S.}} = \alpha^2 mc^2 \left(-\frac{\alpha^2}{2n^4}\right)
     \left(\frac{n}{j+\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{3}{4} \right)
\end{align}
and then the *fine structure only depends on $J$ , and not on $L, S$ separately*
. So that tells us that eventually the spin of the electron and the fine
structure really have deep origins in the relativistic nature of the underlying
physics.

但这个简并只对单电子的系统有效. 见 Demtröder, W. Atoms, Molecules and Photons:

Heidelberg, 2018)  第 167, 168 页 5.5.4
Spin-Orbit Coupling and Fine Structure.

[[file:2022-02-19-专业笔记-MITAMO07/FS_Hydrogen.png]]

So that means at the level of $10^{-4}$ eV, we understand atomic structure. But
we want to go further. And the next thing we want to discuss is that --- what is
the exact degeneracy between $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{1/2}$ which is actually lifted
when we introduce photons when we allow the electrons to couple to the
electromagnetic field, that's QED. And that introduces the Lamb shift (the
nucleus is a point charge, has no structure).

When we bring in the proton. So far we have said there is a point charge, but
the proton is a particle which has finite size. But also, it has finite angular
momentum. And then we have HFS.

* Lamb Shift (QED)

The discovery of this lifting of the degeneracy actually opened up the field for
the development of quantum electrodynamics.

If you fully quantize the electromagnetic field, you have a vector potential
which describes the vacuum mode. And you have a vector potential, which is the
operator of the fully-quantized field. And if you now carry out second-order
perturbation theory in this operator $A$ of the quantized electromagnetic
field. In other words, you allow the atom or the electron in the atom to couple
to all the empty modes of the vacuum. Then you obtain the Lamb shift in its full beauty.


The nature of the Lamb shift is the coupling to the vacuum modes. But I want to
capture that now in a semi-classical picture.

** Simple picture due to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_A._Welton][Welton]] & [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Weisskopf][Weisskopf]]

the vacuum is filled with a zero point energy of the electromagnetic field.

EM modes  have zero point energy $\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$ density of modes (per volume
and frequency interval)

#+begin_quote
Now in addition to its own trembling motion, the electron is now shaken by the
electric field of vacuum. And this leads to an additional smear out. This is the
Lamb shift.
#+end_quote
\begin{align}
\rho(\nu) \mathrm{d}\nu = 8\pi \frac{\nu^2}{c^3}\mathrm{d}\nu
\end{align}
zero point density
\begin{align}
W_0 = \frac{1}{2}h\nu \rho(\nu) = 4\pi\frac{h\nu^3}{c^3} = \frac{1}{8\pi} E_{\nu^2}
\end{align}
So therefore, what we derive from this picture, that the vacuum is filled with
an oscillating electric field. And this oscillating electric field is
characterized by a value, by a spectral density
\begin{align}
E_{\nu}^2 = \frac{32\pi^2 h\nu^3}{c^3}
\end{align}

What is the effect of such a field on a free electron? And we will later discuss
that for very high-frequencies, an electron can be regarded as free.
\begin{align}
m \ddot{s_{\nu}} =& e E_{\nu} \cos (2\pi\nu t) \\
\Rightarrow s_{\nu} =& \frac{e E_{\nu}}{2\pi \nu^2 m}(- \cos(2\pi\nu t))
\end{align}
where $s$ is coordinate of electron.

Of course, the phase is random, so we're not interested in the amplitude . We
are interested in sort of an average amplitude square or an RMS amplitude.
\begin{align}
\bar{S_{\nu}^2} = \frac{e^2}{32\pi^4m^2\nu^4}E_{\nu}^2 = \frac{c^2h}{\pi^2 m^2 e^3}\frac{1}{\nu}
\end{align}
like Darwin term
\begin{align}
\Delta V = \frac{s_{\nu}^2}{6} \nabla^2 V(r) = \frac{s_{\nu}^2}{6} \cdot 4\pi z\delta(r)
\end{align}
These smear out ( $s_{\nu}^2$ ) of the electron leads to a change of the average Coulomb
potential. And that means now that we get a change of the binding energy of the
electron, which is nothing else in perturbation theory than the matrix element
of the perturbation operator
\begin{align}
\delta W_{\nu} = \frac{2\pi}{3} e^2 s_{\nu}^2 \langle \psi | \delta(r) | \psi\rangle
\end{align}
$\langle \psi | \delta(r) | \psi\rangle$ only affects s electron $\frac{Z^3}{\pi n^3a_0^3}$

integrate over $\nu$
\begin{align}
\delta W = \frac{4}{3\pi}\alpha^3 \frac{Z^4}{n^e}
    \mathrm{ln} \left[ \frac{\nu_{\mathrm{max}}}{\nu_{\mathrm{min}}} \right]
\end{align}
we have divergences at both ends. So we need a cutoff at a minimum and at a
maximum frequency. $\nu_{\mathrm{max}} \approx mc^2$ , $\nu_{\mathrm{min}} =$ frequency
of the orbital electron
\begin{align}
\frac{Z^2}{n^3} 2 \mathrm{Ryd.}
\end{align}
so
\begin{align}
\frac{\nu_{\mathrm{max}}}{\nu_{\mathrm{min}}}
\approx \frac{n^3}{Z^2\alpha^{2}}
\end{align}
if we apply it to 2s state which is most important because there is the
degeneracy between $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{1/2}$ to be lifted, we get a result that
the energy splitting is now
\begin{align}
\delta W = \frac{1}{6\pi}\alpha^3 \mathrm{ln}\frac{8}{\alpha^2}\approx 1600 \mathrm{MHz}
\end{align}
exact value is 1058 MHz.
